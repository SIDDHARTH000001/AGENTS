# AI Agents with LangGraph

This repository contains a collection of AI agents developed using LangGraph. The agents demonstrate various approaches to task solving, collaboration, and hierarchical decision-making. New agents and features will be added in future updates to expand the repository's capabilities.

## Features
- **LangGraph Basics:**
  - Learn the fundamentals of building agents with LangGraph using `AGENT.ipynb`.
- **Hierarchical Decision-Making:**
  - Explore the use of hierarchical agents in `Hierarchicalagent.ipynb`.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:**
  - Understand how agents can work together in `Multi-agent.ipynb` and `multi-agent-collaboration.ipynb`.
- **Research Agent:**
  - Specialized agent for research tasks in `ResearchAgent.ipynb`.

## Upcoming Updates
- Addition of new agents with advanced capabilities.
- Examples of agents solving real-world problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies listed in `REQ_FINAL.txt`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r REQ_FINAL.txt
  ```

### Running Examples

Open any `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment to explore and execute the agent implementations. For example:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the desired notebook (e.g., `AGENT.ipynb`) and follow the instructions.
