So far this year, Bitcoin has a change of 54.96%. Bitcoin is classified as a Currency under CoinDesks Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority.The Bitcoin network (with an upper-case “B”) was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto.” The network is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that uses a cryptocurrency called bitcoin (lower case “b”) to transfer value over the internet or act as a store of value like gold and silver.Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis (the smallest units of bitcoin), making individual bitcoin divisible up to eight decimal places. That means anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.Bitcoin priceBitcoin’s price is renowned for being highly volatile, but despite that, it has become the top performing asset of any class (including stocks, commodities and bonds) over the past decade – climbing a staggering 9,000,000% between 2010 and 2020.When the cryptocurrency was launched at the beginning of 2009, as Satoshi Nakamoto mined the bitcoin genesis block (the first-ever block on the Bitcoin blockchain), 50 BTC entered circulation at a price of $0.00.Fifty bitcoin continued to enter circulation every block (created once every 10 minutes) until the first halving event took place in November 2012 (see below). Halvings refer to bitcoin’s issuance system, which was programmed into Bitcoin’s code by Satoshi Nakamoto. It essentially involves automatically halving the number of new BTC entering circulation every 210,000 blocks.In February 2011, BTC’s price reached parity with the U.S dollar for the first time. The milestone encouraged new investors into the market, and over the next four months, bitcoin’s price continued to rise – peaking at over $30.By early 2013, the leading cryptocurrency had recovered from a prolonged bearish episode and rose above $1,000, albeit only briefly. But with the infamous Mt Gox hack, China announcing its first ban on crypto and other situations, it took a further four years for the BTC price to return to above $1,000 again. Once that level was passed, however, bitcoin’s price continued to surge dramatically throughout 2017 until BTC peaked at its previous long-standing all-time high of $19,850.Over 2018, the entire crypto market plunged into what is now known as the “crypto winter” – a yearlong bear market. It wasn’t until December 2020, when bitcoin returned to test the previous all-time high, that it eventually surpassed that historical level and rose a further 239% over the next 119 days to a new all-time high of $64,799.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority. It was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto'.How does Bitcoin work?Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are like the email of the financial world. The currency doesn’t exist in a physical form, and the coin is transacted directly between the sender and the receiver without banking intermediaries to facilitate the transaction. Everything is done publicly through a transparent, immutable, distributed ledger technology called blockchain.Here are the main features of blockchain technology:Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, distributed ledger known as a “blockchain” that anyone can download and help maintain.Transactions are sent directly from the sender to the receiver without any intermediaries.Holders who store their own bitcoin have complete control over it. It cannot be accessed without the holder’s cryptographic key.Bitcoin doesn’t exist in a physical form.Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million. No more bitcoin can be created and units of bitcoin cannot be destroyed.Bitcoin users send and receive coins over the network by inputting the public-key information attached to each person’s digital wallet.In order to incentivize the distributed network of people verifying bitcoin transactions (miners), a fee is attached to each transaction. The fee is awarded to whichever miner adds the transaction to a new block. Fees work on a first-price auction system, where the higher the fee attached to the transaction, the more likely a miner will process that transaction first.Every single bitcoin transaction that takes place has to be permanently committed to the Bitcoin blockchain ledger through a process called “mining.” Bitcoin mining refers to the process where miners compete using specialized computer equipment known as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips to unlock the next block in the chain.Unlocking blocks work as follows:Crypto mining uses a system called cryptographic hashing. This function simply takes any input (messages, words or data of any kind) and turns it into a fixed-length alphanumeric code known as a “hash.”Each input creates a completely unique hash, and it’s almost impossible to predict what inputs will create certain hashes. Even changing one character of the input will result in a totally different fixed-length code.Each new block has a value called a “target hash.” In order to win the right to fill the next block, miners need to produce a hash that is lower than or equal to the numeric value of the ‘target’ hash. Since hashes are completely random, it’s just a matter of trial and error until one miner is successful.This method of requiring miners to use machines and spend time and energy trying to achieve something is known as a proof-of-work system and is designed to deter malicious agents from spamming or disrupting the network.Whoever successfully unlocks the next block is rewarded with a set number of bitcoin known as “block rewards” and gets to add a number of transactions to the new block. They also earn any transaction fees attached to the transactions they add to the new block. A new block is discovered roughly once every 10 minutes.Bitcoin block rewards decrease over time. Every 210,000 blocks, or about once every four years, the number of bitcoin received from each block reward is halved to gradually reduce the number of bitcoin entering the space over time. As of 2021, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins each time they mine a new block. The next bitcoin halving is expected to occur in 2024 and will see bitcoin block rewards drop to 3.125 bitcoins per block. As the supply of new bitcoin entering the market gets smaller, it will make buying bitcoin more competitive – assuming demand for bitcoin remains high.Who created Bitcoin?The creator of Bitcoin, known only by the pseudonym \"Satoshi Nakamoto,\" first proposed this revolutionary digital currency in a 2008 whitepaper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" Satoshi devised Bitcoin as a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, able to facilitate financial transactions without a central authority like a government or bank. In doing so, Satoshi solved a key issue, the double-spending problem, by creating a proof-of-work consensus mechanism within a blockchain structure. Bitcoin's network was activated in January 2009 when Satoshi mined the first block, or the \"genesis block.\" Despite the transformative impact of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto's identity remains shrouded in mystery, a symbol of the privacy-oriented ethos at the heart of the cryptocurrency movement.Bitcoin’s energy consumptionThe process of requiring network contributors to dedicate time and resources to creating new blocks ensures the network remains secure. But that security comes at a price. As of 2021, the Bitcoin network consumes about 93 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year – around the same energy consumed by the 34th-largest country in the world.This appetite for electricity has drawn widespread criticism from celebrities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk to government bodies such as China’s State Council and the U.S. Senate over Bitcoin’s impact on climate change. But while the electricity figures are alarmingly high, it’s important to note that bitcoin mining at most accounts for 1.29% of any single country’s energy consumption. Not to mention, Bitcoin is a complete financial system whose energy consumption can be measured and tracked, unlike the fiat system, which cannot be accurately measured and requires a range of additional layers to function, including ATMs, card machines, bank branches, security vehicles, storage facilities and huge data centers.There are also a number of initiatives including the Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Mining Council that aim to improve Bitcoin’s carbon footprint by encouraging miners to use renewable sources of energy.ManagementAs already mentioned, the Bitcoin network was created by a pseudonymous programmer, or group of programmers, known only as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” During its early development, other developers joined to work on the protocol, including cypherpunk Hal Finney, cryptographers Wei Dai and Nick Szabo and software developer Gavin Andresen.There were also a range of other developers including Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd who contributed to the development of Bitcoin Core – the first client on the Bitcoin network. A client is a piece of software that enables a network participant to run a node and connect to the blockchain.An American nonprofit called the Bitcoin Foundation was founded in 2012 to support the development and adoption of the Bitcoin protocol. After three years, however, the foundation eventually ran out of cash and was dissolved.In 2014, Adam Back, another cypherpunk and the inventor of Hashcash – a cryptographic hashing algorithm created in 1997 which used the same proof-of-work mechanism that Bitcoin would later adopt – co-founded Blockstream. Blockstream is a for-profit tech company that develops new infrastructure on the Bitcoin network, including Lightning Network and sidechains.Read less...Buy crypto on a secure, trusted platform.Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries.

So far this year, Bitcoin has a change of 54.96%. Bitcoin is classified as a Currency under CoinDesks Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority.The Bitcoin network (with an upper-case “B”) was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto.” The network is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that uses a cryptocurrency called bitcoin (lower case “b”) to transfer value over the internet or act as a store of value like gold and silver.Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis (the smallest units of bitcoin), making individual bitcoin divisible up to eight decimal places. That means anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.Bitcoin priceBitcoin’s price is renowned for being highly volatile, but despite that, it has become the top performing asset of any class (including stocks, commodities and bonds) over the past decade – climbing a staggering 9,000,000% between 2010 and 2020.When the cryptocurrency was launched at the beginning of 2009, as Satoshi Nakamoto mined the bitcoin genesis block (the first-ever block on the Bitcoin blockchain), 50 BTC entered circulation at a price of $0.00.Fifty bitcoin continued to enter circulation every block (created once every 10 minutes) until the first halving event took place in November 2012 (see below). Halvings refer to bitcoin’s issuance system, which was programmed into Bitcoin’s code by Satoshi Nakamoto. It essentially involves automatically halving the number of new BTC entering circulation every 210,000 blocks.In February 2011, BTC’s price reached parity with the U.S dollar for the first time. The milestone encouraged new investors into the market, and over the next four months, bitcoin’s price continued to rise – peaking at over $30.By early 2013, the leading cryptocurrency had recovered from a prolonged bearish episode and rose above $1,000, albeit only briefly. But with the infamous Mt Gox hack, China announcing its first ban on crypto and other situations, it took a further four years for the BTC price to return to above $1,000 again. Once that level was passed, however, bitcoin’s price continued to surge dramatically throughout 2017 until BTC peaked at its previous long-standing all-time high of $19,850.Over 2018, the entire crypto market plunged into what is now known as the “crypto winter” – a yearlong bear market. It wasn’t until December 2020, when bitcoin returned to test the previous all-time high, that it eventually surpassed that historical level and rose a further 239% over the next 119 days to a new all-time high of $64,799.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority. It was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto'.How does Bitcoin work?Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are like the email of the financial world. The currency doesn’t exist in a physical form, and the coin is transacted directly between the sender and the receiver without banking intermediaries to facilitate the transaction. Everything is done publicly through a transparent, immutable, distributed ledger technology called blockchain.Here are the main features of blockchain technology:Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, distributed ledger known as a “blockchain” that anyone can download and help maintain.Transactions are sent directly from the sender to the receiver without any intermediaries.Holders who store their own bitcoin have complete control over it. It cannot be accessed without the holder’s cryptographic key.Bitcoin doesn’t exist in a physical form.Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million. No more bitcoin can be created and units of bitcoin cannot be destroyed.Bitcoin users send and receive coins over the network by inputting the public-key information attached to each person’s digital wallet.In order to incentivize the distributed network of people verifying bitcoin transactions (miners), a fee is attached to each transaction. The fee is awarded to whichever miner adds the transaction to a new block. Fees work on a first-price auction system, where the higher the fee attached to the transaction, the more likely a miner will process that transaction first.Every single bitcoin transaction that takes place has to be permanently committed to the Bitcoin blockchain ledger through a process called “mining.” Bitcoin mining refers to the process where miners compete using specialized computer equipment known as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips to unlock the next block in the chain.Unlocking blocks work as follows:Crypto mining uses a system called cryptographic hashing. This function simply takes any input (messages, words or data of any kind) and turns it into a fixed-length alphanumeric code known as a “hash.”Each input creates a completely unique hash, and it’s almost impossible to predict what inputs will create certain hashes. Even changing one character of the input will result in a totally different fixed-length code.Each new block has a value called a “target hash.” In order to win the right to fill the next block, miners need to produce a hash that is lower than or equal to the numeric value of the ‘target’ hash. Since hashes are completely random, it’s just a matter of trial and error until one miner is successful.This method of requiring miners to use machines and spend time and energy trying to achieve something is known as a proof-of-work system and is designed to deter malicious agents from spamming or disrupting the network.Whoever successfully unlocks the next block is rewarded with a set number of bitcoin known as “block rewards” and gets to add a number of transactions to the new block. They also earn any transaction fees attached to the transactions they add to the new block. A new block is discovered roughly once every 10 minutes.Bitcoin block rewards decrease over time. Every 210,000 blocks, or about once every four years, the number of bitcoin received from each block reward is halved to gradually reduce the number of bitcoin entering the space over time. As of 2021, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins each time they mine a new block. The next bitcoin halving is expected to occur in 2024 and will see bitcoin block rewards drop to 3.125 bitcoins per block. As the supply of new bitcoin entering the market gets smaller, it will make buying bitcoin more competitive – assuming demand for bitcoin remains high.Who created Bitcoin?The creator of Bitcoin, known only by the pseudonym \"Satoshi Nakamoto,\" first proposed this revolutionary digital currency in a 2008 whitepaper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" Satoshi devised Bitcoin as a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, able to facilitate financial transactions without a central authority like a government or bank. In doing so, Satoshi solved a key issue, the double-spending problem, by creating a proof-of-work consensus mechanism within a blockchain structure. Bitcoin's network was activated in January 2009 when Satoshi mined the first block, or the \"genesis block.\" Despite the transformative impact of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto's identity remains shrouded in mystery, a symbol of the privacy-oriented ethos at the heart of the cryptocurrency movement.Bitcoin’s energy consumptionThe process of requiring network contributors to dedicate time and resources to creating new blocks ensures the network remains secure. But that security comes at a price. As of 2021, the Bitcoin network consumes about 93 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year – around the same energy consumed by the 34th-largest country in the world.This appetite for electricity has drawn widespread criticism from celebrities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk to government bodies such as China’s State Council and the U.S. Senate over Bitcoin’s impact on climate change. But while the electricity figures are alarmingly high, it’s important to note that bitcoin mining at most accounts for 1.29% of any single country’s energy consumption. Not to mention, Bitcoin is a complete financial system whose energy consumption can be measured and tracked, unlike the fiat system, which cannot be accurately measured and requires a range of additional layers to function, including ATMs, card machines, bank branches, security vehicles, storage facilities and huge data centers.There are also a number of initiatives including the Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Mining Council that aim to improve Bitcoin’s carbon footprint by encouraging miners to use renewable sources of energy.ManagementAs already mentioned, the Bitcoin network was created by a pseudonymous programmer, or group of programmers, known only as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” During its early development, other developers joined to work on the protocol, including cypherpunk Hal Finney, cryptographers Wei Dai and Nick Szabo and software developer Gavin Andresen.There were also a range of other developers including Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd who contributed to the development of Bitcoin Core – the first client on the Bitcoin network. A client is a piece of software that enables a network participant to run a node and connect to the blockchain.An American nonprofit called the Bitcoin Foundation was founded in 2012 to support the development and adoption of the Bitcoin protocol. After three years, however, the foundation eventually ran out of cash and was dissolved.In 2014, Adam Back, another cypherpunk and the inventor of Hashcash – a cryptographic hashing algorithm created in 1997 which used the same proof-of-work mechanism that Bitcoin would later adopt – co-founded Blockstream. Blockstream is a for-profit tech company that develops new infrastructure on the Bitcoin network, including Lightning Network and sidechains.Read less...Buy crypto on a secure, trusted platform.Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries.

      " What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners who verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.\n",
      " Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " Read on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to mine it, buy it, and what it can be used for.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored using a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain.Bitcoin and its ledger are secured by the number of participants in its network and by the way the system confirms and verifies transactions.Bitcoin can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges.Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has undergone several boom and bust cycles over its relatively short lifespan.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " Origin In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than on a centralized server, as is typical of data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists how many transactions are in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This makes it so blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 600 quintillion hashes (as of May 15, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark ordered 100,000 ASICs from Bitmain in April 2024.\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying bitcoin as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching a high of about $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      "Bitcoin's all-time high price is $73,794, reached on March 14, 2024.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of May 2024, bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any newsworthy events.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on bitcoin but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of May 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission put its long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " How Long Does It Take To Mine One Bitcoin?\n",
      "It takes an average of 10 minutes for the mining network to validate a block and create the reward. The bitcoin reward is 3.125 BTC per block. The block reward halves every four years, so when the next halving occurs in mid-2028, the reward will be 1.5625 BTC every 10 minutes.\n",
      " Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n",
      "Bitcoin has a short investment history that is filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investing portfolio, risk tolerance, and investing goals. You should consider consulting with a financial professional before investing in cryptocurrency to ensure that it is right for your circumstances.\n",
      " How Does Bitcoin Make Money?\n",
      "Miners on the Bitcoin network can be rewarded by successfully opening blocks. Bitcoins are exchangeable for fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors and speculators can make money from trading bitcoins.\n",
      " How Many Bitcoins Are Left?\n",
      "The total number of bitcoins in existence was about 19.7 million on May 15, 2024. At that time, the number left to be mined was about 1.3 million.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

      " What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners who verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.\n",
      " Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " Read on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to mine it, buy it, and what it can be used for.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored using a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain.Bitcoin and its ledger are secured by the number of participants in its network and by the way the system confirms and verifies transactions.Bitcoin can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges.Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has undergone several boom and bust cycles over its relatively short lifespan.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " Origin In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than on a centralized server, as is typical of data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists how many transactions are in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This makes it so blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 600 quintillion hashes (as of May 15, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark ordered 100,000 ASICs from Bitmain in April 2024.\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying bitcoin as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching a high of about $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      "Bitcoin's all-time high price is $73,794, reached on March 14, 2024.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of May 2024, bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any newsworthy events.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on bitcoin but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of May 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission put its long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " How Long Does It Take To Mine One Bitcoin?\n",
      "It takes an average of 10 minutes for the mining network to validate a block and create the reward. The bitcoin reward is 3.125 BTC per block. The block reward halves every four years, so when the next halving occurs in mid-2028, the reward will be 1.5625 BTC every 10 minutes.\n",
      " Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n",
      "Bitcoin has a short investment history that is filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investing portfolio, risk tolerance, and investing goals. You should consider consulting with a financial professional before investing in cryptocurrency to ensure that it is right for your circumstances.\n",
      " How Does Bitcoin Make Money?\n",
      "Miners on the Bitcoin network can be rewarded by successfully opening blocks. Bitcoins are exchangeable for fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors and speculators can make money from trading bitcoins.\n",
      " How Many Bitcoins Are Left?\n",
      "The total number of bitcoins in existence was about 19.7 million on May 15, 2024. At that time, the number left to be mined was about 1.3 million.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

      " How Much of the World's Money is in Bitcoin?\n",
      " What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners who verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.\n",
      " Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " Read on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to mine it, buy it, and what it can be used for.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored using a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain.Bitcoin and its ledger are secured by the number of participants in its network and by the way the system confirms and verifies transactions.Bitcoin can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges.Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has undergone several boom and bust cycles over its relatively short lifespan.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " Origin In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than on a centralized server, as is typical of data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists how many transactions are in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This makes it so blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 600 quintillion hashes (as of May 15, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark ordered 100,000 ASICs from Bitmain in April 2024.\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying bitcoin as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching a high of about $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      "Bitcoin's all-time high price is $73,794, reached on March 14, 2024.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of May 2024, bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any newsworthy events.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on bitcoin but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of May 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission put its long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " How Long Does It Take To Mine One Bitcoin?\n",
      "It takes an average of 10 minutes for the mining network to validate a block and create the reward. The bitcoin reward is 3.125 BTC per block. The block reward halves every four years, so when the next halving occurs in mid-2028, the reward will be 1.5625 BTC every 10 minutes.\n",
      " Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n",
      "Bitcoin has a short investment history that is filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investing portfolio, risk tolerance, and investing goals. You should consider consulting with a financial professional before investing in cryptocurrency to ensure that it is right for your circumstances.\n",
      " How Does Bitcoin Make Money?\n",
      "Miners on the Bitcoin network can be rewarded by successfully opening blocks. Bitcoins are exchangeable for fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors and speculators can make money from trading bitcoins.\n",
      " How Many Bitcoins Are Left?\n",
      "The total number of bitcoins in existence was about 19.7 million on May 15, 2024. At that time, the number left to be mined was about 1.3 million.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

      "After reading the website content on Investopedia, it is clear that there are several potential risks associated with BTC market movements. These risks include regulatory risk, security risk, insurance risk, fraud risk, and market risk. Regulatory risk refers to the uncertainty surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies by authorities, which could impact their longevity and liquidity. Security risk relates to the fact that most individuals who own and use bitcoin buy and sell it on cryptocurrency exchanges, which are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches. Insurance risk refers to the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Fraud risk refers to the fact that there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity despite the security measures inherent within a blockchain. Finally, market risk refers to the fact that bitcoin values can fluctuate greatly and are highly sensitive to any newsworthy events. Overall, it is important to carefully consider and mitigate these risks when trading BTC, and to have a clear risk management plan in place.\u001b[0m\n",

      " What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners who verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.\n",
      " Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " Read on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to mine it, buy it, and what it can be used for.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored using a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain.Bitcoin and its ledger are secured by the number of participants in its network and by the way the system confirms and verifies transactions.Bitcoin can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges.Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has undergone several boom and bust cycles over its relatively short lifespan.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " Origin In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than on a centralized server, as is typical of data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists how many transactions are in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This makes it so blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 600 quintillion hashes (as of May 15, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark ordered 100,000 ASICs from Bitmain in April 2024.\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying bitcoin as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching a high of about $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      "Bitcoin's all-time high price is $73,794, reached on March 14, 2024.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of May 2024, bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any newsworthy events.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on bitcoin but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of May 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission put its long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " How Long Does It Take To Mine One Bitcoin?\n",
      "It takes an average of 10 minutes for the mining network to validate a block and create the reward. The bitcoin reward is 3.125 BTC per block. The block reward halves every four years, so when the next halving occurs in mid-2028, the reward will be 1.5625 BTC every 10 minutes.\n",
      " Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n",
      "Bitcoin has a short investment history that is filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investing portfolio, risk tolerance, and investing goals. You should consider consulting with a financial professional before investing in cryptocurrency to ensure that it is right for your circumstances.\n",
      " How Does Bitcoin Make Money?\n",
      "Miners on the Bitcoin network can be rewarded by successfully opening blocks. Bitcoins are exchangeable for fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors and speculators can make money from trading bitcoins.\n",
      " How Many Bitcoins Are Left?\n",
      "The total number of bitcoins in existence was about 19.7 million on May 15, 2024. At that time, the number left to be mined was about 1.3 million.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

So far this year, Bitcoin has a change of 54.96%. Bitcoin is classified as a Currency under CoinDesks Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS).Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority.The Bitcoin network (with an upper-case “B”) was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto.” The network is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that uses a cryptocurrency called bitcoin (lower case “b”) to transfer value over the internet or act as a store of value like gold and silver.Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis (the smallest units of bitcoin), making individual bitcoin divisible up to eight decimal places. That means anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.Bitcoin priceBitcoin’s price is renowned for being highly volatile, but despite that, it has become the top performing asset of any class (including stocks, commodities and bonds) over the past decade – climbing a staggering 9,000,000% between 2010 and 2020.When the cryptocurrency was launched at the beginning of 2009, as Satoshi Nakamoto mined the bitcoin genesis block (the first-ever block on the Bitcoin blockchain), 50 BTC entered circulation at a price of $0.00.Fifty bitcoin continued to enter circulation every block (created once every 10 minutes) until the first halving event took place in November 2012 (see below). Halvings refer to bitcoin’s issuance system, which was programmed into Bitcoin’s code by Satoshi Nakamoto. It essentially involves automatically halving the number of new BTC entering circulation every 210,000 blocks.In February 2011, BTC’s price reached parity with the U.S dollar for the first time. The milestone encouraged new investors into the market, and over the next four months, bitcoin’s price continued to rise – peaking at over $30.By early 2013, the leading cryptocurrency had recovered from a prolonged bearish episode and rose above $1,000, albeit only briefly. But with the infamous Mt Gox hack, China announcing its first ban on crypto and other situations, it took a further four years for the BTC price to return to above $1,000 again. Once that level was passed, however, bitcoin’s price continued to surge dramatically throughout 2017 until BTC peaked at its previous long-standing all-time high of $19,850.Over 2018, the entire crypto market plunged into what is now known as the “crypto winter” – a yearlong bear market. It wasn’t until December 2020, when bitcoin returned to test the previous all-time high, that it eventually surpassed that historical level and rose a further 239% over the next 119 days to a new all-time high of $64,799.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority. It was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto'.How does Bitcoin work?Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are like the email of the financial world. The currency doesn’t exist in a physical form, and the coin is transacted directly between the sender and the receiver without banking intermediaries to facilitate the transaction. Everything is done publicly through a transparent, immutable, distributed ledger technology called blockchain.Here are the main features of blockchain technology:Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, distributed ledger known as a “blockchain” that anyone can download and help maintain.Transactions are sent directly from the sender to the receiver without any intermediaries.Holders who store their own bitcoin have complete control over it. It cannot be accessed without the holder’s cryptographic key.Bitcoin doesn’t exist in a physical form.Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million. No more bitcoin can be created and units of bitcoin cannot be destroyed.Bitcoin users send and receive coins over the network by inputting the public-key information attached to each person’s digital wallet.In order to incentivize the distributed network of people verifying bitcoin transactions (miners), a fee is attached to each transaction. The fee is awarded to whichever miner adds the transaction to a new block. Fees work on a first-price auction system, where the higher the fee attached to the transaction, the more likely a miner will process that transaction first.Every single bitcoin transaction that takes place has to be permanently committed to the Bitcoin blockchain ledger through a process called “mining.” Bitcoin mining refers to the process where miners compete using specialized computer equipment known as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips to unlock the next block in the chain.Unlocking blocks work as follows:Crypto mining uses a system called cryptographic hashing. This function simply takes any input (messages, words or data of any kind) and turns it into a fixed-length alphanumeric code known as a “hash.”Each input creates a completely unique hash, and it’s almost impossible to predict what inputs will create certain hashes. Even changing one character of the input will result in a totally different fixed-length code.Each new block has a value called a “target hash.” In order to win the right to fill the next block, miners need to produce a hash that is lower than or equal to the numeric value of the ‘target’ hash. Since hashes are completely random, it’s just a matter of trial and error until one miner is successful.This method of requiring miners to use machines and spend time and energy trying to achieve something is known as a proof-of-work system and is designed to deter malicious agents from spamming or disrupting the network.Whoever successfully unlocks the next block is rewarded with a set number of bitcoin known as “block rewards” and gets to add a number of transactions to the new block. They also earn any transaction fees attached to the transactions they add to the new block. A new block is discovered roughly once every 10 minutes.Bitcoin block rewards decrease over time. Every 210,000 blocks, or about once every four years, the number of bitcoin received from each block reward is halved to gradually reduce the number of bitcoin entering the space over time. As of 2021, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins each time they mine a new block. The next bitcoin halving is expected to occur in 2024 and will see bitcoin block rewards drop to 3.125 bitcoins per block. As the supply of new bitcoin entering the market gets smaller, it will make buying bitcoin more competitive – assuming demand for bitcoin remains high.Who created Bitcoin?The creator of Bitcoin, known only by the pseudonym \"Satoshi Nakamoto,\" first proposed this revolutionary digital currency in a 2008 whitepaper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" Satoshi devised Bitcoin as a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, able to facilitate financial transactions without a central authority like a government or bank. In doing so, Satoshi solved a key issue, the double-spending problem, by creating a proof-of-work consensus mechanism within a blockchain structure. Bitcoin's network was activated in January 2009 when Satoshi mined the first block, or the \"genesis block.\" Despite the transformative impact of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto's identity remains shrouded in mystery, a symbol of the privacy-oriented ethos at the heart of the cryptocurrency movement.Bitcoin’s energy consumptionThe process of requiring network contributors to dedicate time and resources to creating new blocks ensures the network remains secure. But that security comes at a price. As of 2021, the Bitcoin network consumes about 93 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year – around the same energy consumed by the 34th-largest country in the world.This appetite for electricity has drawn widespread criticism from celebrities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk to government bodies such as China’s State Council and the U.S. Senate over Bitcoin’s impact on climate change. But while the electricity figures are alarmingly high, it’s important to note that bitcoin mining at most accounts for 1.29% of any single country’s energy consumption. Not to mention, Bitcoin is a complete financial system whose energy consumption can be measured and tracked, unlike the fiat system, which cannot be accurately measured and requires a range of additional layers to function, including ATMs, card machines, bank branches, security vehicles, storage facilities and huge data centers.There are also a number of initiatives including the Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Mining Council that aim to improve Bitcoin’s carbon footprint by encouraging miners to use renewable sources of energy.ManagementAs already mentioned, the Bitcoin network was created by a pseudonymous programmer, or group of programmers, known only as “Satoshi Nakamoto.” During its early development, other developers joined to work on the protocol, including cypherpunk Hal Finney, cryptographers Wei Dai and Nick Szabo and software developer Gavin Andresen.There were also a range of other developers including Pieter Wuille and Peter Todd who contributed to the development of Bitcoin Core – the first client on the Bitcoin network. A client is a piece of software that enables a network participant to run a node and connect to the blockchain.An American nonprofit called the Bitcoin Foundation was founded in 2012 to support the development and adoption of the Bitcoin protocol. After three years, however, the foundation eventually ran out of cash and was dissolved.In 2014, Adam Back, another cypherpunk and the inventor of Hashcash – a cryptographic hashing algorithm created in 1997 which used the same proof-of-work mechanism that Bitcoin would later adopt – co-founded Blockstream. Blockstream is a for-profit tech company that develops new infrastructure on the Bitcoin network, including Lightning Network and sidechains.Read less...Buy crypto on a secure, trusted platform.Cryptoasset investing is highly volatile and unregulated in some EU countries.

      " What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners who verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.\n",
      " Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " Read on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to mine it, buy it, and what it can be used for.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored using a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain.Bitcoin and its ledger are secured by the number of participants in its network and by the way the system confirms and verifies transactions.Bitcoin can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges.Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has undergone several boom and bust cycles over its relatively short lifespan.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " Origin In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than on a centralized server, as is typical of data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists how many transactions are in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This makes it so blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 600 quintillion hashes (as of May 15, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark ordered 100,000 ASICs from Bitmain in April 2024.\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying bitcoin as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching a high of about $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      "Bitcoin's all-time high price is $73,794, reached on March 14, 2024.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of May 2024, bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any newsworthy events.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on bitcoin but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of May 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission put its long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " How Long Does It Take To Mine One Bitcoin?\n",
      "It takes an average of 10 minutes for the mining network to validate a block and create the reward. The bitcoin reward is 3.125 BTC per block. The block reward halves every four years, so when the next halving occurs in mid-2028, the reward will be 1.5625 BTC every 10 minutes.\n",
      " Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n",
      "Bitcoin has a short investment history that is filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investing portfolio, risk tolerance, and investing goals. You should consider consulting with a financial professional before investing in cryptocurrency to ensure that it is right for your circumstances.\n",
      " How Does Bitcoin Make Money?\n",
      "Miners on the Bitcoin network can be rewarded by successfully opening blocks. Bitcoins are exchangeable for fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors and speculators can make money from trading bitcoins.\n",
      " How Many Bitcoins Are Left?\n",
      "The total number of bitcoins in existence was about 19.7 million on May 15, 2024. At that time, the number left to be mined was about 1.3 million.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

      " Investing in Bitcoin (BTCUSD) can seem complicated, but it isn't. It only requires an account at a service or a cryptocurrency exchange and a way to store your purchases safely.\n",
      " Bitcoin investors need a cryptocurrency exchange account, personal identification documents if you are using a Know Your Client (KYC) platform, a secure connection to the internet, a method of payment, and a personal digital wallet outside the exchange account. Valid methods of Bitcoin payment include bank accounts, debit cards, and credit cards. It's also possible to get bitcoin at specialized ATMs and via peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Bitcoin's value comes from its store of value and payment system and its finite supply.Because a bitcoin wallet or exchange account can be compromised, it's key to find out about safe storage and practice it and to take the necessary crypto security measures.Services such as Coinbase, PayPal, and Robinhood, among others, sell bitcoin.\n",
      " Before You Buy Bitcoin Privacy and security are important issues in the Bitcoin world. Investors who gain the private key to a public address, which is a cryptographic code similar to a password that allows a user to accept cryptocurrencies in their account on the Bitcoin blockchain can authorize transactions. Private keys should be kept secret, and investors must be aware that the balance of a public address is visible.\n",
      " Individuals can create multiple public addresses and distribute their collection of bitcoin over many addresses. A good strategy is to keep significant investments at public addresses, which aren't directly connected to those used in transactions.\n",
      "Less Than 1 Bitcoin\n",
      "Investors can buy less than a whole bitcoin. Whether a wallet is 1 bitcoin, 15 bitcoins, or 0.01 bitcoin, investors are equally exposed to the cryptocurrency's ups and downs. Coinbase requires a minimum investment of 1 of your local currency, such as $1 or €1.\n",
      " The history of transactions made on the blockchain is transparent, but identifying user information isn't. On the Bitcoin blockchain, only a user's public key appears next to a transaction, making transactions confidential, but not anonymous.\n",
      " Bitcoin transactions are more traceable than cash because they are available for public view and it is very difficult to trace the transacting parties on the cryptocurrency's blockchain. However, researchers and the FBI have claimed that they can track transactions made on the Bitcoin blockchain to users' other online accounts, including their digital wallets.\n",
      " When an investor creates an account on Coinbase, they must provide their identification. If they send it to another wallet, it can still be traced back to the Coinbase purchase connected to the account holder's identity.\n",
      "Before buying bitcoin, be sure to check out the legal, regulatory, and tax status of purchasing it where you live.\n",

      " How To Buy Bitcoin  Step 1: Choose a Crypto-Trading Service or Venue Exchanges are a convenient option because they offer a breadth of features and more cryptocurrencies for trading. Exchanges also enable investors to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency and allow users to transfer crypto to their online wallet for safekeeping.\n",
      " There are many types of cryptocurrency exchanges. Some allow users to remain anonymous and are decentralized and don't require users to enter personal information. For certain demographics, including refugees or those living in countries with little to no infrastructure for government credit or banking, anonymous exchanges can help bring them into the mainstream economy.\n",
      " Popular exchanges in the U.S. aren't decentralized and follow laws that require users to submit identifying documentation. These exchanges include Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and Binance; they offer bitcoin and a growing number of altcoins.\n",
      "When creating a cryptocurrency exchange account, use two-factor authentication and a long, unique password that includes a variety of letters—lowercased and capitalized—special characters, and numbers.\n",
      " Step 2: Connect Your Exchange to a Payment Option Depending on the exchange, personal identification can be required and may mean that you have to include a picture of a driver's license or Social Security card, as well as information about your employer and source of funds. The process is largely the same as setting up a typical brokerage account.\n",
      " At most exchanges, you can connect your bank account directly or you can link it to a debit or credit card. Although you can use a credit card to purchase cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency price volatility could inflate the overall cost of purchasing a token when combined with a credit card's interest charges. Bitcoin is legal in the U.S., but some banks may question or even stop deposits to crypto-related sites or exchanges.\n",
      " Fees vary for deposits via a bank account, debit, or credit card, and exchanges also charge fees per transaction.\n",
      " Step 3: Place an Order Cryptocurrency exchanges have evolved and now mimic the same features as their stockbrokerage counterparts. Crypto exchanges offer several order types and ways to invest. Almost all crypto exchanges offer both market and limit orders, and some also provide stop-loss orders.\n",
      " Kraken offers the most order types, which include market, limit, stop-loss, stop-limit, take-profit, and take-profit limit orders.\n",
      " Exchanges also offer ways to set up recurring investments, allowing clients to dollar-cost average into their investments of choice. Coinbase, for example, lets users set recurring purchases for every day, week, or month.\n",
      " Step 4: Safe Storage Bitcoin and cryptocurrency wallets are a place to store digital assets more securely. Keeping crypto outside the exchange and in a personal wallet ensures that investors have control over the private key to the funds. An exchange wallet is offered, but not recommended, for large or long-term cryptocurrency holdings.\n",
      " Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets Hot Wallets Online wallets, also known as hot wallets, are apps on devices such as computers, phones, or tablets. These wallets generate the private keys to your coins on internet-connected devices.\n",
      " The user of an online or hot wallet isn't the holder of the private key to the cryptocurrency that is held in it. Exchange wallets are custodial accounts provided by the exchange. If the exchange is hacked, investor funds are compromised. The phrase \"not your key, not your coin\" is heavily repeated within cryptocurrency forums and communities.\n",
      " Hot wallet holders who haven't created enough security run the risk of losing funds to theft. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and safe internet browsing should be considered minimum requirements.\n",
      " Hot wallets are best for small amounts of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency that is actively trading on an exchange and may be used like a checking account.\n",
      " Cold Wallets A cold wallet isn't connected to the internet and is at less risk of being compromised. These offline wallets or hardware wallets store a user's private key on something that isn't connected to the internet and come with software that allows investors to view their portfolio without putting their private key at risk. \n",
      " A paper wallet is a wallet generated at certain websites that produces both public and private keys printed on paper. Many people laminate these paper wallets and store them in safe deposit boxes at their bank or even in a safe in their home.\n",
      " A hardware wallet is typically a USB-drive device that stores a user's private keys securely offline. Such wallets have advantages over hot wallets because they are unaffected by viruses that could infect one's computer. With hardware wallets, private keys never come into contact with a network-connected computer or potentially vulnerable software.\n",
      " Cold wallets are the most secure way to store your bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They do require technical knowledge to set up, though.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin With PayPal You can buy bitcoin through a payment processor like PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL). There are two ways to purchase bitcoin using PayPal, by connecting your account to a debit card or bank account or by using the balance of the PayPal account to purchase cryptocurrencies from a third-party provider.\n",
      " You may also use PayPal to directly buy four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Except for those who live in Hawaii, residents of all other states can either use their existing PayPal accounts or set up a new one to buy bitcoin. Additionally, you can use your cryptocurrencies to purchase products and services through the \"Checkout With Crypto\" feature.\n",
      " When you buy bitcoin directly from PayPal, it earns money from the crypto spread, or the difference between Bitcoin's market price and its exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. For each purchase, PayPal also charges a transaction fee, which depends on the dollar amount purchased.\n",
      " You can send crypto, including Bitcoin, from PayPal to an external digital asset wallet that you own and control, or to one owned and controlled by another person like a friend or family member. To send your bitcoin outside of PayPal, you will need to provide the wallet address where you want to send the assets. If you are sending bitcoin, you must use a destination wallet address designated for Bitcoin—you can't use one designated for Bitcoin Cash, for example.\n",
      " The social trading and multi-asset investment company eToro is among the few online traders that allow the use of PayPal to purchase bitcoin on its platform.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin With a Credit Card Using credit cards to buy bitcoin is similar to using debit cards or automated clearing house (ACH) transfers. However, not all exchanges allow you to buy bitcoin with credit cards, due to associated processing fees and the risk of fraud.\n",
      " Credit card processing can tack on extra charges to such transactions. In addition to paying transaction fees, there may be processing fees that the exchange may pass onto the buyer. Credit card issuers treat bitcoin purchases as cash advances and charge hefty fees and interest rates on such advances.\n",
      " For instance, American Express users will pay the current cash advance fee for such transactions, and the fee charged will vary by exchange. The credit card company also limits users to $1,000 worth of bitcoin purchases per month.\n",
      " Alternative Ways to Buy Bitcoin Bitcoin ATMs Bitcoin ATMs act like in-person bitcoin exchanges. Individuals can insert cash into a machine and use it to purchase bitcoin, which gets transferred to online wallets for users. Bitcoin ATMs have become increasingly popular in recent years and are available at the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT).\n",
      "Bitcoin ATMs began requiring government-issued IDs in early 2020.\n",
      " Two charges are associated with ATM bitcoin purchases: a purchase fee and a conversion fee for converting a fiat currency to bitcoin. Both fees are fairly steep compared with those of other options. The worldwide average purchase fee at bitcoin ATMs is 8.4% of the purchase amount and 5.4% for sales at ATMs.   \n",
      " P2P Exchanges Some P2P exchange services provide a more direct connection between users. LocalBitcoins is an example of such an exchange. After creating an account, users can post requests to buy or sell bitcoin, including information about payment methods and prices.\n",
      " Although P2P exchanges don't offer the same anonymity as decentralized exchanges, they allow users the chance to shop around for the best deal. Many of these exchanges also provide rating systems, so that users have a way to evaluate potential trade partners before transacting.\n",
      " Mainstream Brokerages   Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is one exchange that offers crypto trading. It charges 0% commission for cryptocurrency trades and purchases and makes money from the payment for order flow, passing its trading volume on to other trading platforms or brokerage firms. Robinhood had enabled trading on its platform for these cryptocurrencies, among others: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic.\n",
      " In contrast, you can trade thousands of cryptocurrencies on Coinbase, and as of 2022, traditional brokers like Fidelity Investments began to include bitcoin investing for 401(k) accounts.\n",
      "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments are not protected by insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). At regular brokerages, the agency protects against the loss of securities and cash in brokerage accounts containing up to $500,000, with a $250,000 cash limit. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase have crime insurance to protect their infrastructure against hacks. But that insurance doesn't protect individual customers from password theft. \n",
      " How To Sell Bitcoin You can sell bitcoin at the same venues where you purchased the cryptocurrency, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and P2P platforms. Typically, the process of selling bitcoin on these platforms is similar to the process for purchasing it.\n",
      " Cryptocurrency exchanges charge a percentage of the crypto sale amount as fees. For example, Coinbase says it may charge a fee when a customer cashes out their crypto, depending on the payment method selected.\n",
      " Exchanges generally have daily and monthly withdrawal limits. Therefore, cash from a large sale may not be immediately available to the trader. However, with Coinbase, for example, there is no limit on the amount of cryptocurrency you can sell.\n",
      " What Are the Steps for Purchasing Bitcoin?\n",
      "The steps are: choosing a venue or exchange to place your order, selecting a payment method, and ensuring safe storage for your purchased cryptocurrency.\n",
      " What Are the Most Popular Venues for Buying Bitcoin?\n",
      "They are cryptocurrency exchanges, brokerage firms, and payment services like PayPal. For indirect ownership of bitcoin, investors can choose to invest in companies that hold the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, such as Tesla Inc. (TSLA) or MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR).\n",
      " How Much Should You Expect to Pay for Bitcoin?\n",
      "Typically, the price consists of a fee-per-trade, plus the cost to convert a fiat currency to bitcoin. The fee-per-trade is a function of the currency amount of the trade, and, naturally, the higher the trade amount, the higher the fee.\n",
      " Is My Bitcoin Purchase Protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC)?\n",
      "No, your bitcoin purchase isn't protected by SIPC. At certain exchanges, like Coinbase, fiat balances in individual accounts may be Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC-) insured for up to $250,000 per account against certain specific risks.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Buying bitcoin can seem complicated if you haven't done it, but it's relatively simple. It just requires an account at a service or an exchange, and a way to store your purchases safely.\n",
      " To buy bitcoin, you must select an appropriate service or venue, connect with a payment method, place an order, and ensure stable storage for purchased cryptocurrency. Each of these steps requires research and a careful assessment of the pros and cons of the relevant service. Bitcoin is available at bitcoin ATMs or from payment services like PayPal and mainstream brokerage firms like Robinhood or Coinbase.\n",

      " How Much of the World's Money is in Bitcoin?\n",
      " What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners who verify transactions and can be purchased on several exchanges.\n",
      " Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " Read on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to mine it, buy it, and what it can be used for.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Launched in 2009, bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Unlike fiat currency, bitcoin is created, distributed, traded, and stored using a decentralized ledger system known as a blockchain.Bitcoin and its ledger are secured by the number of participants in its network and by the way the system confirms and verifies transactions.Bitcoin can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges.Bitcoin's history as a store of value has been turbulent; it has undergone several boom and bust cycles over its relatively short lifespan.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " Origin In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than on a centralized server, as is typical of data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists how many transactions are in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This makes it so blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 600 quintillion hashes (as of May 15, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark ordered 100,000 ASICs from Bitmain in April 2024.\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying bitcoin as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching a high of about $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      "Bitcoin's all-time high price is $73,794, reached on March 14, 2024.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature mean its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of May 2024, bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any newsworthy events.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on bitcoin but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of May 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission put its long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " How Long Does It Take To Mine One Bitcoin?\n",
      "It takes an average of 10 minutes for the mining network to validate a block and create the reward. The bitcoin reward is 3.125 BTC per block. The block reward halves every four years, so when the next halving occurs in mid-2028, the reward will be 1.5625 BTC every 10 minutes.\n",
      " Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n",
      "Bitcoin has a short investment history that is filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investing portfolio, risk tolerance, and investing goals. You should consider consulting with a financial professional before investing in cryptocurrency to ensure that it is right for your circumstances.\n",
      " How Does Bitcoin Make Money?\n",
      "Miners on the Bitcoin network can be rewarded by successfully opening blocks. Bitcoins are exchangeable for fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors and speculators can make money from trading bitcoins.\n",
      " How Many Bitcoins Are Left?\n",
      "The total number of bitcoins in existence was about 19.7 million on May 15, 2024. At that time, the number left to be mined was about 1.3 million.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

      "Close\n",
      " Investing in Bitcoin (BTCUSD) can seem complicated, but it isn't. It only requires an account at a service or a cryptocurrency exchange and a way to store your purchases safely.\n",
      " Bitcoin investors need a cryptocurrency exchange account, personal identification documents if you are using a Know Your Client (KYC) platform, a secure connection to the internet, a method of payment, and a personal digital wallet outside the exchange account. Valid methods of Bitcoin payment include bank accounts, debit cards, and credit cards. It's also possible to get bitcoin at specialized ATMs and via peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Bitcoin's value comes from its store of value and payment system and its finite supply.Because a bitcoin wallet or exchange account can be compromised, it's key to find out about safe storage and practice it and to take the necessary crypto security measures.Services such as Coinbase, PayPal, and Robinhood, among others, sell bitcoin.\n",
      " Before You Buy Bitcoin Privacy and security are important issues in the Bitcoin world. Investors who gain the private key to a public address, which is a cryptographic code similar to a password that allows a user to accept cryptocurrencies in their account on the Bitcoin blockchain can authorize transactions. Private keys should be kept secret, and investors must be aware that the balance of a public address is visible.\n",
      " Individuals can create multiple public addresses and distribute their collection of bitcoin over many addresses. A good strategy is to keep significant investments at public addresses, which aren't directly connected to those used in transactions.\n",
      "Less Than 1 Bitcoin\n",
      "Investors can buy less than a whole bitcoin. Whether a wallet is 1 bitcoin, 15 bitcoins, or 0.01 bitcoin, investors are equally exposed to the cryptocurrency's ups and downs. Coinbase requires a minimum investment of 1 of your local currency, such as $1 or €1.\n",
      " The history of transactions made on the blockchain is transparent, but identifying user information isn't. On the Bitcoin blockchain, only a user's public key appears next to a transaction, making transactions confidential, but not anonymous.\n",
      " Bitcoin transactions are more traceable than cash because they are available for public view and it is very difficult to trace the transacting parties on the cryptocurrency's blockchain. However, researchers and the FBI have claimed that they can track transactions made on the Bitcoin blockchain to users' other online accounts, including their digital wallets.\n",
      " When an investor creates an account on Coinbase, they must provide their identification. If they send it to another wallet, it can still be traced back to the Coinbase purchase connected to the account holder's identity.\n",
      "Before buying bitcoin, be sure to check out the legal, regulatory, and tax status of purchasing it where you live.\n",

      " How To Buy Bitcoin  Step 1: Choose a Crypto-Trading Service or Venue Exchanges are a convenient option because they offer a breadth of features and more cryptocurrencies for trading. Exchanges also enable investors to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency and allow users to transfer crypto to their online wallet for safekeeping.\n",
      " There are many types of cryptocurrency exchanges. Some allow users to remain anonymous and are decentralized and don't require users to enter personal information. For certain demographics, including refugees or those living in countries with little to no infrastructure for government credit or banking, anonymous exchanges can help bring them into the mainstream economy.\n",
      " Popular exchanges in the U.S. aren't decentralized and follow laws that require users to submit identifying documentation. These exchanges include Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and Binance; they offer bitcoin and a growing number of altcoins.\n",
      "When creating a cryptocurrency exchange account, use two-factor authentication and a long, unique password that includes a variety of letters—lowercased and capitalized—special characters, and numbers.\n",
      " Step 2: Connect Your Exchange to a Payment Option Depending on the exchange, personal identification can be required and may mean that you have to include a picture of a driver's license or Social Security card, as well as information about your employer and source of funds. The process is largely the same as setting up a typical brokerage account.\n",
      " At most exchanges, you can connect your bank account directly or you can link it to a debit or credit card. Although you can use a credit card to purchase cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency price volatility could inflate the overall cost of purchasing a token when combined with a credit card's interest charges. Bitcoin is legal in the U.S., but some banks may question or even stop deposits to crypto-related sites or exchanges.\n",
      " Fees vary for deposits via a bank account, debit, or credit card, and exchanges also charge fees per transaction.\n",
      " Step 3: Place an Order Cryptocurrency exchanges have evolved and now mimic the same features as their stockbrokerage counterparts. Crypto exchanges offer several order types and ways to invest. Almost all crypto exchanges offer both market and limit orders, and some also provide stop-loss orders.\n",
      " Kraken offers the most order types, which include market, limit, stop-loss, stop-limit, take-profit, and take-profit limit orders.\n",
      " Exchanges also offer ways to set up recurring investments, allowing clients to dollar-cost average into their investments of choice. Coinbase, for example, lets users set recurring purchases for every day, week, or month.\n",
      " Step 4: Safe Storage Bitcoin and cryptocurrency wallets are a place to store digital assets more securely. Keeping crypto outside the exchange and in a personal wallet ensures that investors have control over the private key to the funds. An exchange wallet is offered, but not recommended, for large or long-term cryptocurrency holdings.\n",
      " Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets Hot Wallets Online wallets, also known as hot wallets, are apps on devices such as computers, phones, or tablets. These wallets generate the private keys to your coins on internet-connected devices.\n",
      " The user of an online or hot wallet isn't the holder of the private key to the cryptocurrency that is held in it. Exchange wallets are custodial accounts provided by the exchange. If the exchange is hacked, investor funds are compromised. The phrase \"not your key, not your coin\" is heavily repeated within cryptocurrency forums and communities.\n",
      " Hot wallet holders who haven't created enough security run the risk of losing funds to theft. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and safe internet browsing should be considered minimum requirements.\n",
      " Hot wallets are best for small amounts of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency that is actively trading on an exchange and may be used like a checking account.\n",
      " Cold Wallets A cold wallet isn't connected to the internet and is at less risk of being compromised. These offline wallets or hardware wallets store a user's private key on something that isn't connected to the internet and come with software that allows investors to view their portfolio without putting their private key at risk. \n",
      " A paper wallet is a wallet generated at certain websites that produces both public and private keys printed on paper. Many people laminate these paper wallets and store them in safe deposit boxes at their bank or even in a safe in their home.\n",
      " A hardware wallet is typically a USB-drive device that stores a user's private keys securely offline. Such wallets have advantages over hot wallets because they are unaffected by viruses that could infect one's computer. With hardware wallets, private keys never come into contact with a network-connected computer or potentially vulnerable software.\n",
      " Cold wallets are the most secure way to store your bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They do require technical knowledge to set up, though.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin With PayPal You can buy bitcoin through a payment processor like PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL). There are two ways to purchase bitcoin using PayPal, by connecting your account to a debit card or bank account or by using the balance of the PayPal account to purchase cryptocurrencies from a third-party provider.\n",
      " You may also use PayPal to directly buy four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Except for those who live in Hawaii, residents of all other states can either use their existing PayPal accounts or set up a new one to buy bitcoin. Additionally, you can use your cryptocurrencies to purchase products and services through the \"Checkout With Crypto\" feature.\n",
      " When you buy bitcoin directly from PayPal, it earns money from the crypto spread, or the difference between Bitcoin's market price and its exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. For each purchase, PayPal also charges a transaction fee, which depends on the dollar amount purchased.\n",
      " You can send crypto, including Bitcoin, from PayPal to an external digital asset wallet that you own and control, or to one owned and controlled by another person like a friend or family member. To send your bitcoin outside of PayPal, you will need to provide the wallet address where you want to send the assets. If you are sending bitcoin, you must use a destination wallet address designated for Bitcoin—you can't use one designated for Bitcoin Cash, for example.\n",
      " The social trading and multi-asset investment company eToro is among the few online traders that allow the use of PayPal to purchase bitcoin on its platform.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin With a Credit Card Using credit cards to buy bitcoin is similar to using debit cards or automated clearing house (ACH) transfers. However, not all exchanges allow you to buy bitcoin with credit cards, due to associated processing fees and the risk of fraud.\n",
      " Credit card processing can tack on extra charges to such transactions. In addition to paying transaction fees, there may be processing fees that the exchange may pass onto the buyer. Credit card issuers treat bitcoin purchases as cash advances and charge hefty fees and interest rates on such advances.\n",
      " For instance, American Express users will pay the current cash advance fee for such transactions, and the fee charged will vary by exchange. The credit card company also limits users to $1,000 worth of bitcoin purchases per month.\n",
      " Alternative Ways to Buy Bitcoin Bitcoin ATMs Bitcoin ATMs act like in-person bitcoin exchanges. Individuals can insert cash into a machine and use it to purchase bitcoin, which gets transferred to online wallets for users. Bitcoin ATMs have become increasingly popular in recent years and are available at the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT).\n",
      "Bitcoin ATMs began requiring government-issued IDs in early 2020.\n",
      " Two charges are associated with ATM bitcoin purchases: a purchase fee and a conversion fee for converting a fiat currency to bitcoin. Both fees are fairly steep compared with those of other options. The worldwide average purchase fee at bitcoin ATMs is 8.4% of the purchase amount and 5.4% for sales at ATMs.   \n",
      " P2P Exchanges Some P2P exchange services provide a more direct connection between users. LocalBitcoins is an example of such an exchange. After creating an account, users can post requests to buy or sell bitcoin, including information about payment methods and prices.\n",
      " Although P2P exchanges don't offer the same anonymity as decentralized exchanges, they allow users the chance to shop around for the best deal. Many of these exchanges also provide rating systems, so that users have a way to evaluate potential trade partners before transacting.\n",
      " Mainstream Brokerages   Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is one exchange that offers crypto trading. It charges 0% commission for cryptocurrency trades and purchases and makes money from the payment for order flow, passing its trading volume on to other trading platforms or brokerage firms. Robinhood had enabled trading on its platform for these cryptocurrencies, among others: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic.\n",
      " In contrast, you can trade thousands of cryptocurrencies on Coinbase, and as of 2022, traditional brokers like Fidelity Investments began to include bitcoin investing for 401(k) accounts.\n",
      "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments are not protected by insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). At regular brokerages, the agency protects against the loss of securities and cash in brokerage accounts containing up to $500,000, with a $250,000 cash limit. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase have crime insurance to protect their infrastructure against hacks. But that insurance doesn't protect individual customers from password theft. \n",
      " How To Sell Bitcoin You can sell bitcoin at the same venues where you purchased the cryptocurrency, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and P2P platforms. Typically, the process of selling bitcoin on these platforms is similar to the process for purchasing it.\n",
      " Cryptocurrency exchanges charge a percentage of the crypto sale amount as fees. For example, Coinbase says it may charge a fee when a customer cashes out their crypto, depending on the payment method selected.\n",
      " Exchanges generally have daily and monthly withdrawal limits. Therefore, cash from a large sale may not be immediately available to the trader. However, with Coinbase, for example, there is no limit on the amount of cryptocurrency you can sell.\n",
      " What Are the Steps for Purchasing Bitcoin?\n",
      "The steps are: choosing a venue or exchange to place your order, selecting a payment method, and ensuring safe storage for your purchased cryptocurrency.\n",
      " What Are the Most Popular Venues for Buying Bitcoin?\n",
      "They are cryptocurrency exchanges, brokerage firms, and payment services like PayPal. For indirect ownership of bitcoin, investors can choose to invest in companies that hold the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, such as Tesla Inc. (TSLA) or MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR).\n",
      " How Much Should You Expect to Pay for Bitcoin?\n",
      "Typically, the price consists of a fee-per-trade, plus the cost to convert a fiat currency to bitcoin. The fee-per-trade is a function of the currency amount of the trade, and, naturally, the higher the trade amount, the higher the fee.\n",
      " Is My Bitcoin Purchase Protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC)?\n",
      "No, your bitcoin purchase isn't protected by SIPC. At certain exchanges, like Coinbase, fiat balances in individual accounts may be Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC-) insured for up to $250,000 per account against certain specific risks.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Buying bitcoin can seem complicated if you haven't done it, but it's relatively simple. It just requires an account at a service or an exchange, and a way to store your purchases safely.\n",
      " To buy bitcoin, you must select an appropriate service or venue, connect with a payment method, place an order, and ensure stable storage for purchased cryptocurrency. Each of these steps requires research and a careful assessment of the pros and cons of the relevant service. Bitcoin is available at bitcoin ATMs or from payment services like PayPal and mainstream brokerage firms like Robinhood or Coinbase.\n",

      "Close\n",
      " Investing in Bitcoin (BTCUSD) can seem complicated, but it isn't. It only requires an account at a service or a cryptocurrency exchange and a way to store your purchases safely.\n",
      " Bitcoin investors need a cryptocurrency exchange account, personal identification documents if you are using a Know Your Client (KYC) platform, a secure connection to the internet, a method of payment, and a personal digital wallet outside the exchange account. Valid methods of Bitcoin payment include bank accounts, debit cards, and credit cards. It's also possible to get bitcoin at specialized ATMs and via peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Bitcoin's value comes from its store of value and payment system and its finite supply.Because a bitcoin wallet or exchange account can be compromised, it's key to find out about safe storage and practice it and to take the necessary crypto security measures.Services such as Coinbase, PayPal, and Robinhood, among others, sell bitcoin.\n",
      " Before You Buy Bitcoin Privacy and security are important issues in the Bitcoin world. Investors who gain the private key to a public address, which is a cryptographic code similar to a password that allows a user to accept cryptocurrencies in their account on the Bitcoin blockchain can authorize transactions. Private keys should be kept secret, and investors must be aware that the balance of a public address is visible.\n",
      " Individuals can create multiple public addresses and distribute their collection of bitcoin over many addresses. A good strategy is to keep significant investments at public addresses, which aren't directly connected to those used in transactions.\n",
      "Less Than 1 Bitcoin\n",
      "Investors can buy less than a whole bitcoin. Whether a wallet is 1 bitcoin, 15 bitcoins, or 0.01 bitcoin, investors are equally exposed to the cryptocurrency's ups and downs. Coinbase requires a minimum investment of 1 of your local currency, such as $1 or €1.\n",
      " The history of transactions made on the blockchain is transparent, but identifying user information isn't. On the Bitcoin blockchain, only a user's public key appears next to a transaction, making transactions confidential, but not anonymous.\n",
      " Bitcoin transactions are more traceable than cash because they are available for public view and it is very difficult to trace the transacting parties on the cryptocurrency's blockchain. However, researchers and the FBI have claimed that they can track transactions made on the Bitcoin blockchain to users' other online accounts, including their digital wallets.\n",
      " When an investor creates an account on Coinbase, they must provide their identification. If they send it to another wallet, it can still be traced back to the Coinbase purchase connected to the account holder's identity.\n",
      "Before buying bitcoin, be sure to check out the legal, regulatory, and tax status of purchasing it where you live.\n",

      " How To Buy Bitcoin  Step 1: Choose a Crypto-Trading Service or Venue Exchanges are a convenient option because they offer a breadth of features and more cryptocurrencies for trading. Exchanges also enable investors to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency and allow users to transfer crypto to their online wallet for safekeeping.\n",
      " There are many types of cryptocurrency exchanges. Some allow users to remain anonymous and are decentralized and don't require users to enter personal information. For certain demographics, including refugees or those living in countries with little to no infrastructure for government credit or banking, anonymous exchanges can help bring them into the mainstream economy.\n",
      " Popular exchanges in the U.S. aren't decentralized and follow laws that require users to submit identifying documentation. These exchanges include Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and Binance; they offer bitcoin and a growing number of altcoins.\n",
      "When creating a cryptocurrency exchange account, use two-factor authentication and a long, unique password that includes a variety of letters—lowercased and capitalized—special characters, and numbers.\n",
      " Step 2: Connect Your Exchange to a Payment Option Depending on the exchange, personal identification can be required and may mean that you have to include a picture of a driver's license or Social Security card, as well as information about your employer and source of funds. The process is largely the same as setting up a typical brokerage account.\n",
      " At most exchanges, you can connect your bank account directly or you can link it to a debit or credit card. Although you can use a credit card to purchase cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency price volatility could inflate the overall cost of purchasing a token when combined with a credit card's interest charges. Bitcoin is legal in the U.S., but some banks may question or even stop deposits to crypto-related sites or exchanges.\n",
      " Fees vary for deposits via a bank account, debit, or credit card, and exchanges also charge fees per transaction.\n",
      " Step 3: Place an Order Cryptocurrency exchanges have evolved and now mimic the same features as their stockbrokerage counterparts. Crypto exchanges offer several order types and ways to invest. Almost all crypto exchanges offer both market and limit orders, and some also provide stop-loss orders.\n",
      " Kraken offers the most order types, which include market, limit, stop-loss, stop-limit, take-profit, and take-profit limit orders.\n",
      " Exchanges also offer ways to set up recurring investments, allowing clients to dollar-cost average into their investments of choice. Coinbase, for example, lets users set recurring purchases for every day, week, or month.\n",
      " Step 4: Safe Storage Bitcoin and cryptocurrency wallets are a place to store digital assets more securely. Keeping crypto outside the exchange and in a personal wallet ensures that investors have control over the private key to the funds. An exchange wallet is offered, but not recommended, for large or long-term cryptocurrency holdings.\n",
      " Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets Hot Wallets Online wallets, also known as hot wallets, are apps on devices such as computers, phones, or tablets. These wallets generate the private keys to your coins on internet-connected devices.\n",
      " The user of an online or hot wallet isn't the holder of the private key to the cryptocurrency that is held in it. Exchange wallets are custodial accounts provided by the exchange. If the exchange is hacked, investor funds are compromised. The phrase \"not your key, not your coin\" is heavily repeated within cryptocurrency forums and communities.\n",
      " Hot wallet holders who haven't created enough security run the risk of losing funds to theft. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and safe internet browsing should be considered minimum requirements.\n",
      " Hot wallets are best for small amounts of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency that is actively trading on an exchange and may be used like a checking account.\n",
      " Cold Wallets A cold wallet isn't connected to the internet and is at less risk of being compromised. These offline wallets or hardware wallets store a user's private key on something that isn't connected to the internet and come with software that allows investors to view their portfolio without putting their private key at risk. \n",
      " A paper wallet is a wallet generated at certain websites that produces both public and private keys printed on paper. Many people laminate these paper wallets and store them in safe deposit boxes at their bank or even in a safe in their home.\n",
      " A hardware wallet is typically a USB-drive device that stores a user's private keys securely offline. Such wallets have advantages over hot wallets because they are unaffected by viruses that could infect one's computer. With hardware wallets, private keys never come into contact with a network-connected computer or potentially vulnerable software.\n",
      " Cold wallets are the most secure way to store your bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They do require technical knowledge to set up, though.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin With PayPal You can buy bitcoin through a payment processor like PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL). There are two ways to purchase bitcoin using PayPal, by connecting your account to a debit card or bank account or by using the balance of the PayPal account to purchase cryptocurrencies from a third-party provider.\n",
      " You may also use PayPal to directly buy four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. Except for those who live in Hawaii, residents of all other states can either use their existing PayPal accounts or set up a new one to buy bitcoin. Additionally, you can use your cryptocurrencies to purchase products and services through the \"Checkout With Crypto\" feature.\n",
      " When you buy bitcoin directly from PayPal, it earns money from the crypto spread, or the difference between Bitcoin's market price and its exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. For each purchase, PayPal also charges a transaction fee, which depends on the dollar amount purchased.\n",
      " You can send crypto, including Bitcoin, from PayPal to an external digital asset wallet that you own and control, or to one owned and controlled by another person like a friend or family member. To send your bitcoin outside of PayPal, you will need to provide the wallet address where you want to send the assets. If you are sending bitcoin, you must use a destination wallet address designated for Bitcoin—you can't use one designated for Bitcoin Cash, for example.\n",
      " The social trading and multi-asset investment company eToro is among the few online traders that allow the use of PayPal to purchase bitcoin on its platform.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin With a Credit Card Using credit cards to buy bitcoin is similar to using debit cards or automated clearing house (ACH) transfers. However, not all exchanges allow you to buy bitcoin with credit cards, due to associated processing fees and the risk of fraud.\n",
      " Credit card processing can tack on extra charges to such transactions. In addition to paying transaction fees, there may be processing fees that the exchange may pass onto the buyer. Credit card issuers treat bitcoin purchases as cash advances and charge hefty fees and interest rates on such advances.\n",
      " For instance, American Express users will pay the current cash advance fee for such transactions, and the fee charged will vary by exchange. The credit card company also limits users to $1,000 worth of bitcoin purchases per month.\n",
      " Alternative Ways to Buy Bitcoin Bitcoin ATMs Bitcoin ATMs act like in-person bitcoin exchanges. Individuals can insert cash into a machine and use it to purchase bitcoin, which gets transferred to online wallets for users. Bitcoin ATMs have become increasingly popular in recent years and are available at the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT).\n",
      "Bitcoin ATMs began requiring government-issued IDs in early 2020.\n",
      " Two charges are associated with ATM bitcoin purchases: a purchase fee and a conversion fee for converting a fiat currency to bitcoin. Both fees are fairly steep compared with those of other options. The worldwide average purchase fee at bitcoin ATMs is 8.4% of the purchase amount and 5.4% for sales at ATMs.   \n",
      " P2P Exchanges Some P2P exchange services provide a more direct connection between users. LocalBitcoins is an example of such an exchange. After creating an account, users can post requests to buy or sell bitcoin, including information about payment methods and prices.\n",
      " Although P2P exchanges don't offer the same anonymity as decentralized exchanges, they allow users the chance to shop around for the best deal. Many of these exchanges also provide rating systems, so that users have a way to evaluate potential trade partners before transacting.\n",
      " Mainstream Brokerages   Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) is one exchange that offers crypto trading. It charges 0% commission for cryptocurrency trades and purchases and makes money from the payment for order flow, passing its trading volume on to other trading platforms or brokerage firms. Robinhood had enabled trading on its platform for these cryptocurrencies, among others: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic.\n",
      " In contrast, you can trade thousands of cryptocurrencies on Coinbase, and as of 2022, traditional brokers like Fidelity Investments began to include bitcoin investing for 401(k) accounts.\n",
      "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments are not protected by insurance from the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC). At regular brokerages, the agency protects against the loss of securities and cash in brokerage accounts containing up to $500,000, with a $250,000 cash limit. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase have crime insurance to protect their infrastructure against hacks. But that insurance doesn't protect individual customers from password theft. \n",
      " How To Sell Bitcoin You can sell bitcoin at the same venues where you purchased the cryptocurrency, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and P2P platforms. Typically, the process of selling bitcoin on these platforms is similar to the process for purchasing it.\n",
      " Cryptocurrency exchanges charge a percentage of the crypto sale amount as fees. For example, Coinbase says it may charge a fee when a customer cashes out their crypto, depending on the payment method selected.\n",
      " Exchanges generally have daily and monthly withdrawal limits. Therefore, cash from a large sale may not be immediately available to the trader. However, with Coinbase, for example, there is no limit on the amount of cryptocurrency you can sell.\n",
      " What Are the Steps for Purchasing Bitcoin?\n",
      "The steps are: choosing a venue or exchange to place your order, selecting a payment method, and ensuring safe storage for your purchased cryptocurrency.\n",
      " What Are the Most Popular Venues for Buying Bitcoin?\n",
      "They are cryptocurrency exchanges, brokerage firms, and payment services like PayPal. For indirect ownership of bitcoin, investors can choose to invest in companies that hold the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, such as Tesla Inc. (TSLA) or MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR).\n",
      " How Much Should You Expect to Pay for Bitcoin?\n",
      "Typically, the price consists of a fee-per-trade, plus the cost to convert a fiat currency to bitcoin. The fee-per-trade is a function of the currency amount of the trade, and, naturally, the higher the trade amount, the higher the fee.\n",
      " Is My Bitcoin Purchase Protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC)?\n",
      "No, your bitcoin purchase isn't protected by SIPC. At certain exchanges, like Coinbase, fiat balances in individual accounts may be Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC-) insured for up to $250,000 per account against certain specific risks.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Buying bitcoin can seem complicated if you haven't done it, but it's relatively simple. It just requires an account at a service or an exchange, and a way to store your purchases safely.\n",
      " To buy bitcoin, you must select an appropriate service or venue, connect with a payment method, place an order, and ensure stable storage for purchased cryptocurrency. Each of these steps requires research and a careful assessment of the pros and cons of the relevant service. Bitcoin is available at bitcoin ATMs or from payment services like PayPal and mainstream brokerage firms like Robinhood or Coinbase.\n",
